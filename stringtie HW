##1) Align the RNAseq reads of HBR_Rep1_ERCC-Mix2 to the reference fasta file using bowtie2. In the tutorial, we enforced the aligner to discard unaligned records and report 20 alignments for reads with multiple alignment. This time you need to change the parameters to keep unaligned records and report the best alignment for reads with multiple alignments. Make sure to choose the option with choose the best alignment while producing meaningful MAPG score. Save the output to "chr22RNAseq_bow.sam" in a new folder "~/workdir/HW6"

# Convert BAM file to SAM file
samtools view -h -o chr22RNAseq_bow.sam bowtie2.bam

###2) Create a historgram table file "mapq.hist" for the mapping quality of the SAM file. The file has 2 columns: one for the values of MAPG and the 2nd for the count of records having such MAPQ value. (Save the file in the same folder)

awk '{print $5}' chr22RNAseq_bow.sam> mapq.txt

nano mapq_hist.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Path to the SAM file
SAM_FILE="/home/bioinformatics/workdir/HW6/chr22RNAseq_bow.sam"

# Path to the output histogram file
HIST_FILE="/home/bioinformatics/workdir/HW6/mapq.hist"

# Generate the MAPQ histogram
awk '($1 !~ /^@/) {print $5}' "$SAM_FILE" | sort -n | uniq -c | awk '{print $1, "\t", $2}' >> "$HIST_FILE"

echo "MAPQ histogram saved to $HIST_FILE"
chmod +x mapq_hist.sh
./mapq_hist.sh

###3) Re-align the reads with MAPQ < 42 to same reference using a splice aware aligner (The alignment should be done in an annotation independent mode i.e. you can NOT use any data from reference annotation files). Save the output sam file as "chr22RNAseq_unaligned.sam" in the same folder
